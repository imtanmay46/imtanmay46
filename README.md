üëã Hello, and welcome to my profile! I am a senior undergraduate student at IIIT-Delhi, specializing in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. My fascination with technology goes beyond just machines‚ÄîI'm deeply intrigued by the potential of AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning to shape our future.

I approach my work with dedication, always striving for excellence and personal growth. Whether it's conducting research or tackling complex technical challenges, I remain committed to honing my skills and pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve. Continuous learning is at the heart of my journey, and I actively seek out new areas of exploration within the evolving world of technology.

Beyond the technical sphere, I believe in balance and mindfulness, prioritizing peace and stability in both my personal and professional life. Every day, I work toward becoming a better version of myself, choosing personal development and well-being over perfection.

I'm always excited to connect with like-minded professionals, exchange knowledge, and collaborate on exciting projects. Let's explore new horizons together‚Äîfeel free to reach out!
